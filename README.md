# SCOIR Technical Interview for Back-End Engineers
This repo contains an exercise intended for Back-End Engineers.

## Instructions
1. Fork this repo.
1. Using technology of your choice, complete [the assignment](./Assignment.md).
1. Update this README with
    * a `How-To` section containing any instructions needed to execute your program.
    * an `Assumptions` section containing documentation on any assumptions made while interpreting the requirements.
1. Before the deadline, submit a pull request with your solution.

## Expectations
1. Please take no more than 8 hours to work on this exercise. Complete as much as possible and then submit your solution.
1. This exercise is meant to showcase how you work. With consideration to the time limit, do your best to treat it like a production system.

## How-to
1. Create new java project (make sure to put it on your desktop!) include all directories in the src folder of the project. Classes can go in the same package called SCOIRproject.

## Assumptions 
1. Used JSON library to create JSON objects for the csv headers. 
1. Also the file path has to match the program for the file to be valid. So it will not work unless you put the SCOIRproject on your desktop.
